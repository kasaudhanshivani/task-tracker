## 💡 Thought Process

* I wanted a UI that is simple and beginner-friendly.
* Tasks should be visible clearly without scrolling too much.
* Every action should be one click (add, complete, delete).
* LocalStorage is used so tasks don't disappear after refresh.

---

## 🚧 Challenges

* Handling task editing logic
* Managing state of tasks
* Designing a clean and minimal UI

---

## 🌱 Improvements (Future)

🔹 Add login & backend (Firebase / Node.js)
🔹 Categories & priority
🔹 Due date & reminder
🔹 AI suggestions for planning tasks
